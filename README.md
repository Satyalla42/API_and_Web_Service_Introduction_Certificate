# üê¶ Twitter API & ‚úâÔ∏è Gmail API Integration Using Python



This project demonstrates the use of Python to interact with the Gmail API and Twitter API through RESTful services. It includes sample code for both retrieving Gmail messages and posting, retrieving, and deleting tweets using the tweepy library.

**Features:**
**Gmail API:**

Fetches email messages from a Gmail account using OAuth 2.0 authentication.
Uses the requests library to make a GET request to Gmail's API and retrieve messages.

**Twitter API:**

Demonstrates basic integration with the Twitter API using tweepy.
Posting Tweets: Sends a tweet programmatically.
Retrieving Tweets: Fetches the latest tweets from the authenticated user's timeline.
Deleting Tweets: Deletes a specific tweet by ID.

**Authentication:**
Both the Gmail and Twitter APIs require OAuth authentication. In this project, authentication tokens have been redacted for security purposes.

**Technologies Used:**
Python: Utilized for API calls and interacting with external services.

**Requests:** Used for making HTTP requests to the Gmail API.

**Tweepy:** A Python library for accessing the Twitter API and performing actions like posting, reading, and deleting tweets.

**OAuth:** Employed for secure authentication in both APIs.

**Security Notice:**
Access tokens and API keys have been redacted to ensure security and privacy in public repositories.

**Learning Outcomes:**
This project showcases how to interact with third-party APIs in Python, specifically focusing on:
- Authentication and authorization using OAuth.
- Making HTTP requests to fetch, send, and delete data from email and social media accounts.
